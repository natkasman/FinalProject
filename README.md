## Found Instrument
Using everyday, recyclable found objects or other humans and making them into a trio band: the saxophone, the drum and the bass.

## Summary
The main goal of the project is to transform everyday objects or other people into a particular music instruments. The music instruments will include the saxophone, drum and bass. They can either play each individual instrument on its own, or interact with one another to form a trio band. People will interact with the device by connecting the found object with the board via a clip or connector, and then tapping or hitting it onto something to produce the sounds of the intruments.

## Component Parts
Hardware: Capacitive touch sensor, alligator clips, Arduino Mega

## Challenges
We anticipate finding the specific sounds (for each note/beat) might be challenging. Since this encourages interactivity, we want to include multiple instruments but we might not be able to include all the sounds we want to in the board. Because our focus is on found objects, we anticipate that finding out whether or not they are conductive will be a challenge—we can only know when we tried it out. If it doesn’t, we will try adding conductive layers (like ink) on the object.

## Timeline
What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible!

Week 1: Write proposal

Week 2: Check out hardware components from Hybrid Lab. Rough prototype to understand how/if it works. Check code.

Week 3: Start on final prototype. Test.

Week 4: Refine, test, debug.

Week 5: Present!
